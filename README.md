#Custom scrapers
Here are some scrapers I made. Mostly in Python.

##Scraper template
A template to quickly build scrapers and store information.

##Law enforcement personnel
A scraper to collect data on law enforcement personnel from the N.C. Department of Justice's [Uniform Crime Reporting Program](http://crimereporting.ncdoj.gov/Reports.aspx), [located here](http://crimereporting.ncdoj.gov/public/2013/LEPersonnel/LEPerPopRatAgyTrd.htm).

**Usage:**

`python lea-personnel.py`
